## Slide Set 4: Heteroskedasticity

- The meaning of each of our assumptions/requirements
- Heteroskedasticity
  - What it is

## Slide Set 5: Living with Heteroskedasticity

- Misspecification
- Weighted least squares

## Slide Set 6: Asymptotics and Consistency

- Asymptotics
  - Compared to 'finite-sample' attributes (probability limits vs. expected values)
  - Probability limits
- Consistency
- Signing the bias from omitted variables.
- Measurement error and attenuation bias.
- Examples of measurement error

## Proofs/derivations you do not need to 'know'

- Measurement error
- The heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors

*Note:* In general, you do not need to memorize proofs. Just understand the steps. I might ask how you get from one step to the next. I won't ask you to write down a full proof.

```{R, generate pdfs, include = F, eval = T}
